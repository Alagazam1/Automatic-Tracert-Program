# Automatic-Tracert-Program

First attempt of an automatic tracert program

You can access the program by downloading the .exe file; "Automatic Tracert Program.exe"

This program attempts to automatically perform a tracert command via the Window's command prompt and then output the results in a text file; "tracert_results.txt", which will then be opened to display the results to the user.

Note; The IP address used for the tracert test is a public Google's DNS Server Address(8.8.8.8).

The full code for the program can be found in the file: "final_program.py"

Additional Notes;

The text file; "tracert_results.txt" will be located in the same directory/folder that the "Automatic Tracert Program.exe" is in.

Program Limitations:
1) User will need notepad.exe on their PC.
2) Program currently only works on the Window OS.
